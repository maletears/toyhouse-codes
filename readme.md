## FAQ
> **How do I use Safehouse?**

[Safehouse](https://safehou-se.vercel.app/) is a template editor for converted Bootstrap and HTML codes. All you need to do is copy and paste the code into their code filler, click *Template-ify*, and then edit the form in the left sidebar. Once you're done and like how it looks, scroll to the bottom and copy the code in the box. Paste it into your [Toyhou.se](https://toyhou.se/) profile and you're done! You can find more information in the Safehouse [documentation](https://safehou-se.vercel.app/docs).

> **Do you have permission to use the codes you convert?**

I do! I will only use F2U codes with permission from their creators.

> **Can I use these codes outside of Toyhouse?**

It depends! You're free to use my own Bootstrap and Safehouse codes outside of Toyhouse *with* credit, but you'll need to ask the original creators for permission to use their codes outside of Toyhouse before you can use my Safehouse conversions.
